## Usage

*(Here you should provide instructions on how to run your program. Since you mentioned there is no command-line interface, you might provide instructions on how to run the Python script and interact with the GUI if you have one, or how to use the functions in the script if it's a library.)*

For example:

### Running the application

To run the application, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open the main window of the application. From there, you can choose to decode, modify, or create a QR code by following the on-screen instructions.
